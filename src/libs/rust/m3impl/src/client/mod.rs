//! Contains client-side abstractions
//!
//! This module contains abstraction to interact with the services that are provided by MÂ³. These
//! are based on a [`ClientSession`] that refers to a corresponding session at the server side,
//! potentially holding client-specific state. Based on the [`ClientSession`], capabilities can be
//! exchanged to establish further communication channels.
//!
//! The [`ClientSession`] is therefore used to provide service-specific APIs on top. For example,
//! [`Pipes`] builds upon a [`ClientSession`] and uses it to perform capability exchanges in order
//! to create pipes and channels to such pipes.
