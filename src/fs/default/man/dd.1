NAME
     dd -- convert and copy a file

SYNOPSIS
     dd [operand ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The dd utility copies the standard input to the standard output, applying any specified con-
     versions.  Input data is read and written in 512-byte blocks.  If input reads are short, in-
     put from multiple reads are aggregated to form the output block.  When finished, dd displays
     the number of complete and partial input and output blocks and truncated input records to
     the standard error output.

     The following operands are available:

     if=file  Read input from file instead of the standard input.

     of=file  Write output to file instead of the standard output.  Any regular output file is
              truncated unless the notrunc conversion value is specified.  If an initial portion
              of the output file is skipped (see the seek operand), the output file is truncated
              at that point.

     ibs=n    Set the input block size to n bytes instead of the default 512.

     obs=n    Set the output block size to n bytes instead of the default 512.

     bs=n     Set both the input and output block size to n bytes, superseding the ibs and obs
              operands.  If no conversion values other than noerror, notrunc, or sync are speci-
              fied, then each input block is copied to the output as a single block without any
              aggregation of short blocks.

     cbs=n    Set the conversion record size to n bytes.  The conversion record size is required
              by the record oriented conversion values.

     count=n  Copy only n input blocks.

     files=n  Copy n input files before terminating.  This operand is only applicable when the
              input device is a tape.

     seek=n   Seek n blocks from the beginning of the output before copying.  On non-tape de-
              vices, an lseek(2) operation is used.  Otherwise, existing blocks are read and the
              data discarded.  If the user does not have read permission for the tape, it is po-
              sitioned using the tape ioctl(2) function calls.  If the seek operation is past the
              end of file, space from the current end of file to the specified offset is filled
              with blocks of NUL bytes.

     skip=n   Skip n blocks from the beginning of the input before copying.  On input which sup-
              ports seeks, an lseek(2) operation is used.  Otherwise, input data is read and dis-
              carded.  For pipes, the correct number of bytes is read.  For all other devices,
              the correct number of blocks is read without distinguishing between a partial or
              complete block being read.

     status=value
              The value is one of the symbols from the following list:

              noxfer   Do not print the transfer statistics as the last line of status output.

              none     Do not print the status output.  Error messages are shown; informational
                       messages are not.

     conv=value[,value ...]
              Each value is one of the symbols from the following list:

              ascii    The same as the unblock value except that characters are translated from
                       EBCDIC to ASCII before the records are converted.  (These values imply
                       unblock if the operand cbs is also specified.)

              block    Treats the input as a sequence of newline or end-of-file terminated vari-
                       able length records independent of input and output block boundaries.  Any
                       trailing newline character is discarded.  Each input record is converted
                       to a fixed length output record where the length is specified by the cbs
                       operand.  Input records shorter than the conversion record size are padded
                       with spaces.  Input records longer than the conversion record size are
                       truncated.  The number of truncated input records, if any, is reported to
                       the standard error output at the completion of the copy.

              ebcdic, ibm
                       The same as the block value except that characters are translated from
                       ASCII to EBCDIC after the records are converted.  (These values imply
                       block if the operand cbs is also specified.)  There are two conversion
                       maps for EBCDIC.  The value ebcdic specifies the recommended one which is
                       compatible with AT&T System V UNIX.  The value ibm is a slightly different
                       mapping, which is compatible with the AT&T System V UNIX ibm value.

              fsync    Call fsync(2) on the output file before exiting.

              lcase    Transform uppercase characters into lowercase characters.

              noerror  Do not stop processing on an input error.  When an input error occurs, a
                       diagnostic message followed by the current input and output block counts
                       will be written to the standard error output in the same format as the
                       standard completion message.  If the sync conversion is also specified,
                       any missing input data will be replaced with NUL bytes (or with spaces if
                       a block oriented conversion value was specified) and processed as a normal
                       input buffer.  If the sync conversion is not specified, the input block is
                       omitted from the output.  On input files which are not tapes or pipes, the
                       file offset will be positioned past the block in which the error occurred
                       using lseek(2).

              notrunc  Do not truncate the output file.  This will preserve any blocks in the
                       output file not explicitly written by dd.  The notrunc value is not sup-
                       ported for tapes.

              osync    Pad the final output block to the full output block size.  This forces the
                       final output block to be the same size as preceding blocks for use on de-
                       vices that require regularly sized blocks to be written.  This option is
                       incompatible with the bs block size specification.

              swab     Swap every pair of input bytes.  If an input buffer has an odd number of
                       bytes, the last byte will be ignored during swapping.

              sync     Pad every input block to the input buffer size.  Spaces are used for pad
                       bytes if a block oriented conversion value is specified, otherwise NUL
                       bytes are used.

              ucase    Transform lowercase characters into uppercase characters.

              unblock  Treats the input as a sequence of fixed length records independent of in-
                       put and output block boundaries.  The length of the input records is spec-
                       ified by the cbs operand.  Any trailing space characters are discarded and
                       a newline character is appended.

     Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.  If the number ends with a
     `b', `k' or `K', `m' or `M', `g' or `G', or `w', the number is multiplied by 512, 1024 (1K),
     1048576 (1M), 1073741824 (1G), or the number of bytes in an integer, respectively.  Two or
     more numbers may be separated by an `x' to indicate a product.

     When finished, dd displays the number of complete and partial input and output blocks, trun-
     cated input records, and odd-length byte-swapping blocks to the standard error output.  A
     partial input block is one where less than the input block size was read.  A partial output
     block is one where less than the output block size was written.  Partial output blocks to
     tape devices are considered fatal errors.  Otherwise, the rest of the block will be written.
     Partial output blocks to character devices will produce a warning message.  A truncated in-
     put block is one where a variable length record oriented conversion value was specified and
     the input line was too long to fit in the conversion record or was not newline terminated.

     Normally, data resulting from input or conversion or both are aggregated into output blocks
     of the specified size.  After the end of input is reached, any remaining output is written
     as a block.  This means that the final output block may be shorter than the output block
     size.

     If dd receives a SIGINFO (see the "status" argument for stty(1)) signal, the current input
     and output block counts will be written to the standard error output in the same format as
     the standard completion message.  If dd receives a SIGINT signal, the current input and out-
     put block counts will be written to the standard error output in the same format as the
     standard completion message and dd will exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The dd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Write an OpenBSD floppy image to a floppy disk:

           # dd if=floppy67.img of=/dev/rfd0c bs=32k

     Create an ISO-9660 image of a CD-ROM:

           # dd if=/dev/rcd0c of=disk.iso bs=32k

STANDARDS
     The dd utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The conversions ascii, ebcdic, and ibm are marked by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") as be-
     ing an X/Open System Interfaces option.

     The files and status operands, the fsync and osync conversions, the `K', `m', `M', `g', `G',
     and `w' size multipliers and SIGINFO handling are all extensions to the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
     ("POSIX.1") specification.
